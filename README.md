# Working with ActiveRecord associations

## Goal

The goal of this repository is to give students a place where they can learn what
ActiveRecord associations are need to display different information on various
Rails views.

## Development

1. Fork and clone the repository
1. Install gems using `bundle install`
1. Create and migrate the databases using `rake db:create:all db:migrate`
1. Run all of the specs using `rake spec`

## Assignment

Your assignment is to remove the pending from the specs
one by one until you get all of the specs passing. The order you
should remove the pendings is noted in the specs.

To get the specs passing, you will need to add various ActiveRecord
association declarations to the different classes in the models
directory. Your best source of details is the [ActiveRecord guide for
associations](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html).
